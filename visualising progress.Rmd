# Visualising progress

## Some ideas

- Start with a chain - for the current user (argument to see what other people are doing, maybe all).
- Visualise by timeline.

## Tasks

- Access current username? `author` field.
- Does the data need to be ordered by time?

```{r Munge}
this_user <- "Nick Golding"

# Get all users' history.
all_history <- git_history()

# Filter by user.
this_user_data <- all_history %>% 
  filter(author == this_user)


git2r::commits() %>% jsonedit()
```


# Construct adjancency matrix

```{r}
matrix(c(0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0), 3, 3) %>% 
  ggnet2()

```
