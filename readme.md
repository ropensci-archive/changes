# simpler version control from R

This is a work in progress!

Our aim is to create a simpler and more intuitive interface to version control of code than git.


## Introduction:
what does it do?
why should you use it?


## Get started!

Three steps to success!
1. Make/download a repository! (this is like turning on track changes)
  - Must define a repository (use pictures!)
2. Make some changes
3. Review those changes (encourage small increments)
4. Record your changes in your repository. 
(repeat steps 2-4 at short intervals)

## More stuff! (Fixing stuff, moving back, saving stuff)

5.  Fixing stuff!
   - go back to previous versions
6. Saving stuff online (non-local!!)
   - Must define local vs remote environments 
   - Push/Sync functions
