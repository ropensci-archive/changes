# simpler version control from R

This is a work in progress!

Our aim is to create a simpler and more intuitive interface to version control of code than git.


## What does stow do?

Stow allows beginners with minimal programming experience to use version control. Version control is a framework that saves previous versions of your work as you develop your projects (Like 'Track changes' in MS Word). You can then easily look at previous versions, merge changes, and collaborate with others, but without the headache! 

Stow uses git under the hood. Git is a popular version control system used by projects such as Android and ggplot2. Don't worry, you don't need to know any git to use stow!


## Get started!

Three steps to success!
1. Make/download a repository! (this is like turning on track changes)
  - Must define a repository (use pictures!)
2. Make some changes
3. Review those changes (encourage small increments)
4. Record your changes in your repository. 
(repeat steps 2-4 at short intervals)

## More stuff! (Fixing stuff, moving back, saving stuff)

5.  Fixing stuff!
   - go back to previous versions
6. Saving stuff online (non-local!!)
   - Must define local vs remote environments 
   - Push/Sync functions
