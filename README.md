## What does stow do?

Stow allows beginners with minimal programming experience to use version control. Version control is a framework that saves previous versions of your work as you develop your projects (Like 'Track changes' in MS Word). You can then easily look at previous versions, merge changes, and collaborate with others, but without the headache! 

Stow uses git under the hood. Git is a popular version control system used by projects such as Android and ggplot2. Don't worry, you don't need to know any git to use stow!

# Installation

This package depends on the [githug](https://github.com/jennybc/githug) package. You can install githug and then stow from github with:

```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jennybc/githug")
devtools::install_github("ropenscilabs/ozrepro")
```
